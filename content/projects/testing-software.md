As part of a 6 month internship at Thales, I had to develop a testing software. It's a unit testing framework in the field of tactical data links. Following this internship, this tool is currently used by the teams in Thales, and allows them to verify if the softwares they develop work properly. I used Python mainly, the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) library, and other internally developped libraries.
