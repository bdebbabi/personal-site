With this personal project, I wanted to track my portfolio over time, and aggregate multiple accounts in the same place. It's possible to visualise the historical gains and value, the composition, the exposure and the holdings. I used [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).
